This will help flag when an issue has arisen. This will depend on the type of merge:\n\n-   1:1 merge (one-to-one merge) – Simplest merge (sometimes things go wrong)\n-   1:m merge (one-to-many merge) – More complex (things often go wrong)\n    -   The \"one\" suggests that one dataset has the merging variable (e.g., id) each represented once and the \"many” implies that one dataset has the merging variable represented multiple times\n-   m:m merge (many-to-many merge) – Danger zone (can be unpredictable)\n    \n\n## one-to-one merge\n\n-   This means that each row of data represents a unique unit of analysis that exists in another dataset (e.g,. id variable)\n-   Will likely have variables that don’t exist in the current dataset (that’s why you are trying to merge it in)\n-   The merging variable (e.g., id) each represented a single time\n-   You should try to structure your data so that a 1:1 merge or 1:m merge is possible so that fewer things can go wrong.\n\n## `merge()` function\n\nWe will use the `merge()` function to conduct one-to-one merge\n\n\n\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'printr':\n  method                from     \n  knit_print.data.frame rmarkdown\n```\n\nMerge Two Data Frames\n\nDescription:\n\n     Merge two data frames by common columns or row names, or do other\n     versions of database _join_ operations.\n\nUsage:\n\n     merge(x, y, ...)\n     \n     ## Default S3 method:\n     merge(x, y, ...)\n     \n     ## S3 method for class 'data.frame'\n     merge(x, y, by = intersect(names(x), names(y)),\n           by.x = by, by.y = by, all = FALSE, all.x = all, all.y = all,\n           sort = TRUE, suffixes = c(\".x\",\".y\"), no.dups = TRUE,\n           incomparables = NULL, ...)\n     \nArguments:\n\n    x, y: data frames, or objects to be coerced to one.\n\nby, by.x, by.y: specifications of the columns used for merging.  See\n          'Details'.\n\n     all: logical; 'all = L' is shorthand for 'all.x = L' and 'all.y =\n          L', where 'L' is either 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.\n\n   all.x: logical; if 'TRUE', then extra rows will be added to the\n          output, one for each row in 'x' that has no matching row in\n          'y'.  These rows will have 'NA's in those columns that are\n          usually filled with values from 'y'.  The default is 'FALSE',\n          so that only rows with data from both 'x' and 'y' are\n          included in the output.\n\n   all.y: logical; analogous to 'all.x'.\n\n    sort: logical.  Should the result be sorted on the 'by' columns?\n\nsuffixes: a character vector of length 2 specifying the suffixes to be\n          used for making unique the names of columns in the result\n          which are not used for merging (appearing in 'by' etc).\n\n no.dups: logical indicating that 'suffixes' are appended in more cases\n          to avoid duplicated column names in the result.  This was\n          implicitly false before R version 3.5.0.\n\nincomparables: values which cannot be matched.  See 'match'.  This is\n          intended to be used for merging on one column, so these are\n          incomparable values of that column.\n\n     ...: arguments to be passed to or from methods.\n\nDetails:\n\n     'merge' is a generic function whose principal method is for data\n     frames: the default method coerces its arguments to data frames\n     and calls the '\"data.frame\"' method.\n\n     By default the data frames are merged on the columns with names\n     they both have, but separate specifications of the columns can be\n     given by 'by.x' and 'by.y'.  The rows in the two data frames that\n     match on the specified columns are extracted, and joined together.\n     If there is more than one match, all possible matches contribute\n     one row each.  For the precise meaning of 'match', see 'match'.\n\n     Columns to merge on can be specified by name, number or by a\n     logical vector: the name '\"row.names\"' or the number '0' specifies\n     the row names.  If specified by name it must correspond uniquely\n     to a named column in the input.\n\n     If 'by' or both 'by.x' and 'by.y' are of length 0 (a length zero\n     vector or 'NULL'), the result, 'r', is the _Cartesian product_ of\n     'x' and 'y', i.e., 'dim(r) = c(nrow(x)*nrow(y), ncol(x) +\n     ncol(y))'.\n\n     If 'all.x' is true, all the non matching cases of 'x' are appended\n     to the result as well, with 'NA' filled in the corresponding\n     columns of 'y'; analogously for 'all.y'.\n\n     If the columns in the data frames not used in merging have any\n     common names, these have 'suffixes' ('\".x\"' and '\".y\"' by default)\n     appended to try to make the names of the result unique.  If this\n     is not possible, an error is thrown.\n\n     If a 'by.x' column name matches one of 'y', and if 'no.dups' is\n     true (as by default), the y version gets suffixed as well,\n     avoiding duplicate column names in the result.\n\n     The complexity of the algorithm used is proportional to the length\n     of the answer.\n\n     In SQL database terminology, the default value of 'all = FALSE'\n     gives a _natural join_, a special case of an _inner join_.\n     Specifying 'all.x = TRUE' gives a _left (outer) join_, 'all.y =\n     TRUE' a _right (outer) join_, and both ('all = TRUE') a _(full)\n     outer join_.  DBMSes do not match 'NULL' records, equivalent to\n     'incomparables = NA' in R.\n\nValue:\n\n     A data frame.  The rows are by default lexicographically sorted on\n     the common columns, but for 'sort = FALSE' are in an unspecified\n     order.  The columns are the common columns followed by the\n     remaining columns in 'x' and then those in 'y'.  If the matching\n     involved row names, an extra character column called 'Row.names'\n     is added at the left, and in all cases the result has 'automatic'\n     row names.\n\nNote:\n\n     This is intended to work with data frames with vector-like\n     columns: some aspects work with data frames containing matrices,\n     but not all.\n\n     Currently long vectors are not accepted for inputs, which are thus\n     restricted to less than 2^31 rows. That restriction also applies\n     to the result for 32-bit platforms.\n\nSee Also:\n\n     'data.frame', 'by', 'cbind'.\n\n     'dendrogram' for a class which has a 'merge' method.\n\nExamples:\n\n     authors <- data.frame(\n         ## I(*) : use character columns of names to get sensible sort order\n         surname = I(c(\"Tukey\", \"Venables\", \"Tierney\", \"Ripley\", \"McNeil\")),\n         nationality = c(\"US\", \"Australia\", \"US\", \"UK\", \"Australia\"),\n         deceased = c(\"yes\", rep(\"no\", 4)))\n     authorN <- within(authors, { name <- surname; rm(surname) })\n     books <- data.frame(\n         name = I(c(\"Tukey\", \"Venables\", \"Tierney\",\n                  \"Ripley\", \"Ripley\", \"McNeil\", \"R Core\")),\n         title = c(\"Exploratory Data Analysis\",\n                   \"Modern Applied Statistics ...\",\n                   \"LISP-STAT\",\n                   \"Spatial Statistics\", \"Stochastic Simulation\",\n                   \"Interactive Data Analysis\",\n                   \"An Introduction to R\"),\n         other.author = c(NA, \"Ripley\", NA, NA, NA, NA,\n                          \"Venables & Smith\"))\n     \n     (m0 <- merge(authorN, books))\n     (m1 <- merge(authors, books, by.x = \"surname\", by.y = \"name\"))\n      m2 <- merge(books, authors, by.x = \"name\", by.y = \"surname\")\n     stopifnot(exprs = {\n        identical(m0, m2[, names(m0)])\n        as.character(m1[, 1]) == as.character(m2[, 1])\n        all.equal(m1[, -1], m2[, -1][ names(m1)[-1] ])\n        identical(dim(merge(m1, m2, by = NULL)),\n                  c(nrow(m1)*nrow(m2), ncol(m1)+ncol(m2)))\n     })\n     \n     ## \"R core\" is missing from authors and appears only here :\n     merge(authors, books, by.x = \"surname\", by.y = \"name\", all = TRUE)\n     \n     \n     ## example of using 'incomparables'\n     x <- data.frame(k1 = c(NA,NA,3,4,5), k2 = c(1,NA,NA,4,5), data = 1:5)\n     y <- data.frame(k1 = c(NA,2,NA,4,5), k2 = c(NA,NA,3,4,5), data = 1:5)\n     merge(x, y, by = c(\"k1\",\"k2\")) # NA's match\n     merge(x, y, by = \"k1\") # NA's match, so 6 rows\n     merge(x, y, by = \"k2\", incomparables = NA) # 2 rows\n\n\n    \n## Lets import the new data we want to merge and take a look\n\nThe new data `serodata_new.csv` represents a follow-up serological survey four years later.

These\n          variables may also be present in wide format.\n\n     ids: the values to use for a newly created 'idvar' variable in\n          long format.\n\n   times: the values to use for a newly created 'timevar' variable in\n          long format.  See 'Details'.\n\n    drop: a vector of names of variables to drop before reshaping.\n\ndirection: character string, partially matched to either '\"wide\"' to\n          reshape to wide format, or '\"long\"' to reshape to long\n          format.\n\nnew.row.names: character or 'NULL': a non-null value will be used for\n          the row names of the result.\n\n     sep: A character vector of length 1, indicating a separating\n          character in the variable names in the wide format.  This is\n          used for guessing 'v.names' and 'times' arguments based on\n          the names in 'varying'.  If 'sep == \"\"', the split is just\n          before the first numeral that follows an alphabetic\n          character.  This is also used to create variable names when\n          reshaping to wide format.\n\n   split: A list with three components, 'regexp', 'include', and\n          (optionally) 'fixed'.  This allows an extended interface to\n          variable name splitting.  See 'Details'.\n\nDetails:\n\n     Although 'reshape()' can be used in a variety of contexts, the\n     motivating application is data from longitudinal studies, and the\n     arguments of this function are named and described in those terms.\n     A longitudinal study is characterized by repeated measurements of\n     the same variable(s), e.g., height and weight, on each unit being\n     studied (e.g., individual persons) at different time points (which\n     are assumed to be the same for all units). These variables are\n     called time-varying variables. The study may include other\n     variables that are measured only once for each unit and do not\n     vary with time (e.g., gender and race); these are called\n     time-constant variables.\n\n     A 'wide' format representation of a longitudinal dataset will have\n     one record (row) for each unit, typically with some time-constant\n     variables that occupy single columns, and some time-varying\n     variables that occupy multiple columns (one column for each time\n     point).  A 'long' format representation of the same dataset will\n     have multiple records (rows) for each individual, with the\n     time-constant variables being constant across these records and\n     the time-varying variables varying across the records.  The 'long'\n     format dataset will have two additional variables: a 'time'\n     variable identifying which time point each record comes from, and\n     an 'id' variable showing which records refer to the same unit.\n\n     The type of conversion (long to wide or wide to long) is\n     determined by the 'direction' argument, which is mandatory unless\n     the 'data' argument is the result of a previous call to 'reshape'.\n     In that case, the operation can be reversed simply using\n     'reshape(data)' (the other arguments are stored as attributes on\n     the data frame).\n\n     Conversion from long to wide format with 'direction = \"wide\"' is\n     the simpler operation, and is mainly useful in the context of\n     multivariate analysis where data is often expected as a\n     wide-format matrix. In this case, the time variable 'timevar' and\n     id variable 'idvar' must be specified. All other variables are\n     assumed to be time-varying, unless the time-varying variables are\n     explicitly specified via the 'v.names' argument.  A warning is\n     issued if time-constant variables are not actually constant.\n\n     Each time-varying variable is expanded into multiple variables in\n     the wide format.  The names of these expanded variables are\n     generated automatically, unless they are specified as the\n     'varying' argument in the form of a list (or matrix) with one\n     component (or row) for each time-varying variable. If 'varying' is\n     a vector of names, it is implicitly converted into a matrix, with\n     one row for each time-varying variable. Use this option with care\n     if there are multiple time-varying variables, as the ordering (by\n     column, the default in the 'matrix' constructor) may be\n     unintuitive, whereas the explicit list or matrix form is\n     unambiguous.\n\n     Conversion from wide to long with 'direction = \"long\"' is the more\n     common operation as most (univariate) statistical modeling\n     functions expect data in the long format. In the simpler case\n     where there is only one time-varying variable, the corresponding\n     columns in the wide format input can be specified as the 'varying'\n     argument, which can be either a vector of column names or the\n     corresponding column indices. The name of the corresponding\n     variable in the long format output combining these columns can be\n     optionally specified as the 'v.names' argument, and the name of\n     the time variables as the 'timevar' argument. The values to use as\n     the time values corresponding to the different columns in the wide\n     format can be specified as the 'times' argument.  If 'v.names' is\n     unspecified, the function will attempt to guess 'v.names' and\n     'times' from 'varying' (an explicitly specified 'times' argument\n     is unused in that case).  The default expects variable names like\n     'x.1', 'x.2', where 'sep = \".\"' specifies to split at the dot and\n     drop it from the name.  To have alphabetic followed by numeric\n     times use 'sep = \"\"'.\n\n     Multiple time-varying variables can be specified in two ways,\n     either with 'varying' as an atomic vector as above, or as a list\n     (or a matrix). The first form is useful (and mandatory) if the\n     automatic variable name splitting as described above is used; this\n     requires the names of all time-varying variables to be suitably\n     formatted in the same manner, and 'v.names' to be unspecified. If\n     'varying' is a list (with one component for each time-varying\n     variable) or a matrix (one row for each time-varying variable),\n     variable name splitting is not attempted, and 'v.names' and\n     'times' will generally need to be specified, although they will\n     default to, respectively, the first variable name in each set, and\n     sequential times.\n\n     Also, guessing is not attempted if 'v.names' is given explicitly,\n     even if 'varying' is an atomic vector. In that case, the number of\n     time-varying variables is taken to be the length of 'v.names', and\n     'varying' is implicitly converted into a matrix, with one row for\n     each time-varying variable. As in the case of long to wide\n     conversion, the matrix is filled up by column, so careful\n     attention needs to be paid to the order of variable names (or\n     indices) in 'varying', which is taken to be like 'x.1', 'y.1',\n     'x.2', 'y.2' (i.e., variables corresponding to the same time point\n     need to be grouped together).\n\n     The 'split' argument should not usually be necessary.  The\n     'split$regexp' component is passed to either 'strsplit' or\n     'regexpr', where the latter is used if 'split$include' is 'TRUE',\n     in which case the splitting occurs after the first character of\n     the matched string.  In the 'strsplit' case, the separator is not\n     included in the result, and it is possible to specify fixed-string\n     matching using 'split$fixed'.\n\nValue:\n\n     The reshaped data frame with added attributes to simplify\n     reshaping back to the original form.\n\nSee Also:\n\n     'stack', 'aperm'; 'relist' for reshaping the result of 'unlist'.\n     'xtabs' and 'as.data.frame.table' for creating contingency tables\n     and converting them back to data frames.\n\nExamples:\n\n     summary(Indometh) # data in long format\n     \n     ## long to wide (direction = \"wide\") requires idvar and timevar at a minimum\n     reshape(Indometh, direction = \"wide\", idvar = \"Subject\", timevar = \"time\")\n     \n     ## can also explicitly specify name of combined variable\n     wide <- reshape(Indometh, direction = \"wide\", idvar = \"Subject\",\n                     timevar = \"time\", v.names = \"conc\", sep= \"_\")\n     wide\n     \n     ## reverse transformation\n     reshape(wide, direction = \"long\")\n     reshape(wide, idvar = \"Subject\", varying = list(2:12),\n             v.names = \"conc\", direction = \"long\")\n     \n     ## times need not be numeric\n     df <- data.frame(id = rep(1:4, rep(2,4)),\n                      visit = I(rep(c(\"Before\",\"After\"), 4)),\n                      x = rnorm(4), y = runif(4))\n     df\n     reshape(df, timevar = \"visit\", idvar = \"id\", direction = \"wide\")\n     ## warns that y is really varying\n     reshape(df, timevar = \"visit\", idvar = \"id\", direction = \"wide\", v.names = \"x\")\n     \n     \n     ##  unbalanced 'long' data leads to NA fill in 'wide' form\n     df2 <- df[1:7, ]\n     df2\n     reshape(df2, timevar = \"visit\", idvar = \"id\", direction = \"wide\")\n     \n     ## Alternative regular expressions for guessing names\n     df3 <- data.frame(id = 1:4, age = c(40,50,60,50), dose1 = c(1,2,1,2),\n                       dose2 = c(2,1,2,1), dose4 = c(3,3,3,3))\n     reshape(df3, direction = \"long\", varying = 3:5, sep = \"\")\n     \n     \n     ## an example that isn't longitudinal data\n     state.x77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)\n     long <- reshape(state.x77, idvar = \"state\", ids = row.names(state.x77),\n                     times = names(state.x77), timevar = \"Characteristic\",\n                     varying = list(names(state.x77)), direction = \"long\")\n     \n     reshape(long, direction = \"wide\")\n     \n     reshape(long, direction = \"wide\", new.row.names = unique(long$state))\n     \n     ## multiple id variables\n     df3 <- data.frame(school = rep(1:3, each = 4), class = rep(9:10, 6),\n                       time = rep(c(1,1,2,2), 3), score = rnorm(12))\n     wide <- reshape(df3, idvar = c(\"school\", \"class\"), direction = \"wide\")\n     wide\n     ## transform back\n     reshape(wide)\n\n\n\n## long to wide data\n\nxxzane - help\n\n\n## wide to long data\n\nxxzane - help\n\n\n## Let's get real\n\nUse the `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` from the tidyr package!\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n-   ...\n\t\t\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThese are the materials we looked through, modified, or extracted to complete this module's lecture.\n\n-   [\"Introduction to R for Public Health Researchers\" Johns Hopkins University](https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/)\n\n",
