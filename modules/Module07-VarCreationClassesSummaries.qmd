## Learning Objectives

After module 7, you should be able to...

-   Create new variables
-		Remove variables


## Import data for this module
Let's first read in the data from the previous module.

```{r echo=TRUE}
df <- read.csv(file = "~/Dropbox/SISMID/data/serodata.csv") #relative path
```



# Adding/Removing Columns

## Adding new columns

You can add a new column, called `newcol` to `df`, using the `$` operator:
```{r}
df$newcol <- df$wt/2.2
head(df,3)
```

## Creating conditional variables

One frequently-used tool is creating variables with conditions. A general function for creating new variables based on existing variables is the Base R `ifelse()` function, which "returns a value depending on whether the element of test is `TRUE` or `FALSE`."

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
library(printr)
?ifelse
```


## `ifelse` example

```{r}
df$disp
```

Now with `ifelse`()
```{r}
#ifelse(test, yes, no)
ifelse(df$disp <= 200, "low", "high")
```


## Removing columns

You can remove a column by assigning to `NULL` or by indeing like we leared in last module
```{r, eval = FALSE}
df$newcol <- NULL 
df <- df[,-"newcol"]
```





## Summary

- Adding (or modifying) columns/variable to a data frame by using `$` 
- can remove a column in a few ways:  
    1. assigning a column to `NULL`  
    2. using `[]` with negative sign in front of column name(s)
