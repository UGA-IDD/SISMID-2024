## Learning Objectives

After module 1, you should be able to...

-   Create and save an R script
-   Describe the utility and differences b/w the Console and the Source panes
-   Modify R Studio panes
-   Create objects
-   Describe the difference b/w character, numeric, list, and matrix objects
-   Reference objects in the RStudio Environment pane
-   Use basic arithmetic operators in R
-   Use comments within an R script to create header, sections, and make notes

## Working with R -- RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R

-   It helps the user effectively use R
-   Makes things easier
-   Is NOT a dropdown statistical tool (such as Stata)
    -   See [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) or also [Rcmdr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html), [Radiant](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/)

```{r, fig.alt="RStudio logo", out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg")
```

## RStudio

Easier working with R

-   Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation
-   Easily manage multiple working directories and projects

More information

-   Workspace browser and data viewer
-   Plot history, zooming, and flexible image and file export
-   Integrated R help and documentation
-   Searchable command history

## RStudio

```{r, fig.alt="RStudio", out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ayeimanolr.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/r-rstudio-1-1.png?w=640&h=382")
```

## Getting the editor

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/both.png")
```

## Working with R in RStudio - 2 major panes:

1) The **Source/Editor**: xxamy

- "Analysis" Script
- Static copy of what you did (reproducibility)
- Top by default
    
2)  The **R Console**: "interprets" whatever you type:

    -   Calculator
    -   Try things out interactively, then add to your editor
    -   Bottom by default

## Source / Editor

-   Where files open to
-   Have R code and comments in them
-   Where code is saved

```{r, out.width = "200%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_script.png")
```

## R Console

-   Where code is executed (where things happen)
-   You can type here for things interactively
-   Code is **not saved**

```{r, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_console.png")
```


## RStudio

Useful RStudio "cheat sheet": <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf>

```{r, fig.alt="RStudio", out.width = "65%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_sheet.png")
```


## RStudio Layout

If RStudio doesn't look the way you want (or like our RStudio), then do:

In R Studio Menu Bar go to View Menu --\> Panes --\> Pane Layout

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pane_layout.png")
```

## Workspace/Environment

-   Tells you what **objects** are in R
-   What exists in memory/what is loaded?/what did I read in?

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_environment.png")
```

## Workspace/History

-   Shows previous commands. Good to look at for debugging, but **don't rely** on it.
-   Also type the "up" and "down" key in the Console to scroll through previous commands

## Workspace/Other Panes

-   **Files** - shows the files on your computer of the directory you are working in
-   **Viewer** - can view data or R objects
-   **Help** - shows help of R commands
-   **Plots** - pictures and figures
-   **Packages** - list of R packages that are loaded in memory

## Getting Started

-   In R Studio Menu Bar go to File Menu --\> New File --\> R Script
-   Save the blank R script as Module1.R

## Explaining output on slides

In slides, the R command/code will be in a box, and then directly after it, will be the output of the code starting with `[1]`

```{r echo=T}
print("I'm code")
```

So `print("I'm code")` is the command and `[1] "I'm code"` is the output.

</br>

Commands/code and output written as inline text will be typewriter blue font. For example `code`

## R as a calculator

You can do basic arithmetic in R, which I surprisingly use all the time.

```{r echo=T}
2 + 2
2 * 4
2^3
```

## R as a calculator

- The R console is a full calculator
- Arithmetic operators:
    - `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` are add, subtract, divide and multiply
    - `^` or `**` is power
    - parentheses -- `(` and `)` -- work with order of operations 
    - `%%` finds the remainder
    

## Execute / Run Code

To execute or run a line of code (i.e., command), you just put your cursor on the command and then:

  1. Press Run (which you will find at the top of your window)

  OR

  2. Press `Cmd + Return` (iOS) OR `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows).

To execute or run multiple lines of code, you need to highlight the code you want to run and then follow option 1 or 2.

## Mini exercise 

Execute `5+4` from your .R file, and then find the answer 9 in the Console.

## Commenting in Scripts

The syntax `#` creates a comment, which means anything to the right of `#` will not be executed / run

Commenting is useful to:

1. Create headers for R Scripts
2. Create sections within an R Script
3. Explain what is happening in your code 

## Commenting an R Script header

Add a comment header to Module1.R.  This is the one I typically use, but you may have your own preference.  The goal is that you are consistent so that future you / collaborators can make sense of your code.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
### Title: Module 1
### Author: Amy Winter 
### Objective: Mini Exercise - Developing first R Script
### Date: 15 July 2024
```

## Commenting to create sections

You can also create sections within your code by ending a comment with 4 hash marks. **This is very useful for creating an outline of your R Script.** The "Outline" can be found in the top right of the your Source pane

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# Section 1 Header ####
## Section 2 Sub-header ####
### Section 3 Sub-sub-header ####
#### Section 4 Sub-sub-sub-header ####
```

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/outline.png")
```


## Commenting to explain code

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
## this # is still a comment
### you can use many #'s as you want

# sometimes you have a really long comment,
#    like explaining what you are doing
#    for a step in analysis. 
# Take it to another line
```

I tend to use:

-   One hash mark with a space to describe what is happening in the following few lines of code
-   One hash mark with no space after a command to list specifics 

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# Practicing my arithmetic
5+2
3*5
9/8

5+2 #5 plus 2 
```

## Object - Basic terms

**Object** - an object is something that can be worked with in R - can be lots of different things!

-   a scalar / number
-   a vector
-   a matrix of numbers
-   a list
-   a plot
-   a function

... many more

## Objects

- You can create objects from within the R environment and from files on your computer
- R uses `<-` to assign values to an object name 
- Note: Object names are case-sensitive, i.e. `X` and `x` are different
- Here are examples of creating five different objects:
```{r echo=T}
number.object <- 3
character.object <- "blue"
vector.object1 <- c(2,3,4,5)
vector.object2 <- c("blue", "red", "yellow")
matrix.object <- matrix(data=vector.object1, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
```

Note, `c()` and `matrix()` are functions, which we will talk more about in module 2.

## Object names

- In general, any object name can be typed into R.
- However, only some are considered "valid". If you use a non-valid object name,
you will have to enclose it in backticks \``like this`\` for R to recognize it.
- From the R documentation:

> A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as ".2way" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.

- Reserved words: `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `for`, `in`,
`next`, `break`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, `NA_integer_`,
`NA_real_`, `NA_Complex_`, `_NA_Character`, `...`, `..1`, `..2`, `..3`, and so on.

## Object names

| Valid        | Invalid |
|--------------|---------|
| `my_object`    | `my-data` |
| `the.vector`   | `2data`   |
| `num12`        | `for`     |
| `measles_data` | `.9data`  |
| `.calc`        | `xX~mŷ_δätą~Xx` |

## Mini Exercise

Try creating one or two of these objects in your R script

```{r echo=T}
number.object <- 3
character.object <- "blue"
vector.object1 <- c(2,3,4,5)
vector.object2 <- c("blue", "red", "yellow")
matrix.object <- matrix(data=vector.object1, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
```

## Objects 

Note, you can find these objects now in the Global Environment.

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/global_env.png")
```


Also, you can print them anytime (i.e, see them in the Console) by executing (running) the object.  For example,

```{r, echo = TRUE}
character.object
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
matrix.object
```


# Object names and assingment - Good coding

xxzane

`=` and `<-` can both be used for assignment, but `<-` is better coding practice, because sometimes `=` doesn't work and we want to distinguish between the logical operator `==`. We will talk about this more, later.

## Lists

List is a special data class, that can hold vectors, strings, matrices, models, list of other lists.

```{r echo=T}
list.object <- list(number.object, vector.object2, matrix.object)
list.object
```


## Useful R Studio Shortcuts

Will certainly save you time

- `Cmd + Return` (iOS) OR `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) in your script evaluates current line/selection
    -   It's like copying and pasting the code into the console for it to run.
- pressing Up/Down in the Console allows you to navigate command history

See <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/keyboard_shortcuts> for many more


## RStudio helps with "tab completion"

If you start typing a object, RStudio will show you options that you can choose without typing out the whole object.


```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tab.completion.png")
```




## Summary

-   RStudio makes working in R easier
-   The Editor is for static code like R Scripts
-   The Console is for testing code that can't be saved
-   Commenting is your new best friend
-   In R we create objects that can be viewed in the Environment pane and used anytime
-   An object is something that can be worked with in R
-   Use `<-` syntax to create objects


## Mini Exercise

1. Create a new number object and name it `my.object`
2. Create a vector of 4 numbers and name it `my.vector` using the `c()` function
3. Add `my.object` and `my.vector` together using an arithmetic operator
