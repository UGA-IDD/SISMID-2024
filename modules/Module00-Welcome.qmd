* Favorite guilty pleasure app


## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

## What is R?

- **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand developed R


- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)

## What is R?

* R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods 
    * includes machine learning algorithm, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to name a few. 

* Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results


## What is R?

- Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
- Transform: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
- Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
- Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
- Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world


## Why R?

* Free (open source)

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Strong community 


## Why not R?

    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Perl, Python)


## Who uses R?

* Data scientist can use two excellent tools: R and Python. 
* A programming language is a tool to compute and communicate your discovery. 
* How do you deal with data (Most important aspect for this course!)
    * import, clean, prep, analyze. This should be your primary focus.
* Data scientist are not programmers. Their job is to understand the data, manipulate it and expose the best approach.

## Is R DIfficult?

* Short answer â€“ It has a steep learning curve. 
* Years ago, R was a difficult language to master. The language was confusing and not as structured as the other programming tools. 
* Hadley Wickham developed a collection of packages called tidyverse. Data manipulation became trivial and intuitive. Creating a graph was not so difficult anymore.



## Workshop Objective

We hope to teach you to fish -- Note in a full semester course some of these more abstract themes are sprinkled in throughout the semester while we continue to learn all sorts of functions.  Here we need you to get some of these main themes as quickly as possible ...
What you can expect at the end
How this differs from Tidy course

We will focus this class on using **base R** because some resources online and R users will use this.

## Tidyverse and Base R

We will mostly show you how to use tidyverse packages and functions. 

This is a newer set of packages designed for data science that can make your code more **intuitive** as compared to the original older Base R.

**Tidyverse advantages**:  
 - **consistent structure** - making it easier to learn how to use different packages  
 - particularly good for **wrangling** (manipulating, cleaning, joining) data  
 - more flexible for **visualizing** data  

Packages for the tidyverse are managed by a team of respected data scientists at RStudio.

* [Basic terms / R jargon](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4419-1318-0%2F1.pdf)
* Common confusion


## Course Format

 * Lecture with slides (possibly "Interactive")
 * Lab/Practical experience
 * One 10 min breaks each day - timing may vary

## Installing R

* Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )

* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** (IDE) that makes it easier to work with R.

More on that soon!
