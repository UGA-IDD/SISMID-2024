## Introductions

* Name?
* Current position / institution?
* Past experience with other statistical programs, including R?
* Why do you want to learn R?
* Favorite useful app
* Favorite guilty pleasure app


## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

## What is R?

- **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand developed R


- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)

## What is R?

* R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods 
    * includes machine learning algorithm, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to name a few. 

* Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results


## What is R?

- Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
- Transform: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
- Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
- Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
- Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world


## Why R?

* Free (open source)

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Strong community 


## Why not R?

    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Perl, Python)


## Is R DIfficult?

* Short answer â€“ It has a steep learning curve. 
* Years ago, R was a difficult language to master. The language was confusing and not as structured as the other programming tools. 
* Hadley Wickham developed a collection of packages called tidyverse. Data manipulation became trivial and intuitive. Creating a graph was not so difficult anymore.



## Overall Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to 

1. start a new project, read in data, and conduct basic data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
2. know how to use and find packages/functions that we did not specifically learn in class
3. troubleshoot errors (xxzane? -- not included right now)


## This workshop differs from "Introduction to Tidyverse"

We will focus this class on using **Base R** functions and packages, i.e., pre-installed into R and the basis for most other functions and packages! If you know Base R then are will be more equipped to use all the other useful/pretty packages that exit.

the Tidyverse is one set of useful/pretty packages, designed to can make your code more **intuitive** as compared to the original older Base R. **Tidyverse advantages**:  

-	**consistent structure** - making it easier to learn how to use different packages
-	particularly good for **wrangling** (manipulating, cleaning, joining) data  
-	more flexible for **visualizing** data

## Workshop Overview

14 lecture blocks that will each:
- Start with learning objectives
- End with summary slides
- Include mini-exercise(s) or a full exercise

Themes that will show up throughout the workshop:
- Reproducibility
- Good coding techniques
- Thinking algorithmically
- [Basic terms / R jargon](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4419-1318-0%2F1.pdf)

## Installing R


Hopefully everyone has pre-installed R and RStudio.  We will take a moment to go around and make sure everyone is ready to go. Please open up your RStudio and leave it open as we check everyone's laptops.

- Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
