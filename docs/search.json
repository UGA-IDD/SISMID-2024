She has been coding in R for 10 years, and uses R day-to-day to conduct her research addressing policy-relevant questions on the transmission and control of infectious diseases in human populations, particularly VPDs. She teaches a semester-long course titled Introduction to Coding in R for Public Health to graduate students at the University of Georgia.\n\n\n\nTA: Zane Billings\n\n\nZane Billings is a PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia, working with Andreas Handel. He has been using R since 2017, and uses R for nearly all of his statistics and data science practice. Zane’s research focuses on the immune response to influenza vaccination, and uses machine learning and multilevel regression modeling (in R!) to improve our understanding of influenza immunology.",
