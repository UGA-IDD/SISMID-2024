Welcome to "Introduction to R"!

This website contains all of the slides and exercises for the [2024
Summer Institute in Modeling for Infectious Diseases (SISMID) Module
"Introduction to R"](https://sph.emory.edu/SISMID/modules/intro-to-r/index.html).

## Prerequisities {.unnumbered}

Familiary with basic statistical concepts on the level of an introductory
statistics class is assumed for our course

Before the course begins, you should install R and RStudio on your laptop.
**If you are using an older version of R, you should update it before the
course begins.** You will need at least R version 4.3.0 for this course, but
using the most recent version (4.4.1 at the time of writing) is always preferable.

* You can install R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/)
by clicking on the correct download link for your OS.
* You can install RStudio from the
[Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

Dr. Winter is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of
Georgia. She has been coding in R for 10 years, and uses R day-to-day to conduct
her research addressing policy-relevant questions on the transmission and
control of infectious diseases in human populations, particularly VPDs. She
teaches a semester-long course titled Introduction to Coding in R for Public
Health to graduate students at the University of Georgia.

Zane Billings is a PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia, working with Andreas Handel. He has been using R since 2017, and uses R for nearly all of his statistics and data science practice. Zaneâ€™s research focuses on the immune response to influenza vaccination, and uses machine learning and multilevel regression modeling (in R!) to improve our understanding of influenza immunology.
